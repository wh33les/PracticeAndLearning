# Sorting algorithms

## Selection sort

## Insertion sort
### Pros
* Runs __in place__, i.e., only a constant number of elements in the input array are stored outside of the array in running the algorithm.

Runs in _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ time.

## Quicksort
_O(n<sup>2</sup>)_; _O(n_ lg _n)_ (expected)

## Merge sort
### Cons
* Does not run in place.

Runs in _O(n_ lg _n)_ time.

## Heapsort
### Pros
* In place.

_O(n_ lg _n)_

# More sorting algorithms
## Counting sort
_O(k+n)_

## Radix sort
_O(d(k+n))_

## Bucket sort
_O(n<sup>2</sup>)_; _O(n)_ (average case)

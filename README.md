# Practice and learning

This repository contains snippets of code that I write.  I make no claims as to the quality of the code written, or to its efficiency.  However, I won't post anything that doesn't compile (unless it is a Markdown file with snippets, but even then I'll do my best to make sure things work).  This repository is really for me to practice.

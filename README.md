This is a readme file.

I think I might reserve this repository for little bits of code that I write.  For example, the solution to that first problem on ProjectEuclid.

I make no claims as to the quality of the code written, or to its efficiency.  However, I won't post anything that doesn't compile (unless it is a Markdown file with snippets, but even then I'll do my best to make sure things work).  This repository is really for me to practice.

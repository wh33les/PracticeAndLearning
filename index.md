## Welcome to Wheeles' Github Page

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my repository settings. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Some helpful websites

[Career Cup](https://www.careercup.com/page) is the webpage by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, author of _Cracking the Coding Interview_.
